# 🧠 NeuralGuru — AI-Powered KBAT Learning Platform

NeuralGuru is an AI-driven Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) designed to help Malaysian students master **KBAT (Kemahiran Berfikir Aras Tinggi)** questions aligned with **MOE (Ministry of Education)** exam formats.

Unlike traditional learning platforms, NeuralGuru does not just show results — it **analyzes learning patterns**, predicts **KBAT weaknesses**, regenerates **similar-context questions**, and guides students step-by-step using AI-assisted learning.

This repository contains the **public landing page** for NeuralGuru.

## 🧩 Platform Context

NeuralGuru is designed as a **multi-service learning platform**, where each major user role and responsibility is handled by a dedicated application or service.

The overall platform includes:

- Student learning dashboards
- Tutor management and scheduling
- Parent performance reporting
- Administrative and institutional oversight
- AI-powered analysis and question generation services

To maintain scalability, security, and clear separation of concerns, these systems are developed and deployed independently.

👉 **This repository only contains the public landing page**, which serves as:

- The primary product introduction
- An entry point for students, tutors, parents, and institutions
- A place to explain pricing, plans, and platform value
- A trust and information hub (FAQs, Help Center, legal pages)

No business logic, AI processing, or authenticated user flows are implemented here.
